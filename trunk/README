To build the library, type

./configure; make

There are several driver programs (drivers/*.C) which make use of
the library which gets built in lib/.

The configuration process is currently very basic, and only tries
to find the GMP/MPFR/GMPFRXX libraries in one place depending on
what type of system you are on.  This could definitely be improved.

There are also some more-or-less OK Matlab/Octave implementations in
the matlab/ directory, though these are strictly double-precision
implementations.  The Gauss Matlab implementation in particular is
very simplistic and should not be relied on for accurate results at
high orders!



Notes on obtaining supporting software:

.) GNU GMP
   The Rudix project provides a pre-built DMG for GMP:
   http://code.google.com/p/rudix/downloads/detail?name=gmp-4.3.1-2.dmg&can=1&q=gmp
   
   Files are installed in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib by default 
   (and I could not see a way to change this).

   Also, this is apparently an i386 library, and this causes problems with
   building MPFR from source later if you are on Snow Leopard, which is a
   64-bit OS....


.) GNU MPFR (http://www.mpfr.org/)
   A C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding.
   A cursory search did not reveal any prebuilt DMG's for this library.
   I grabbed source code from http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr-3.0.1.tar.bz2
   ./configure --with-gmp-include=/usr/local/include --with-gmp-lib=/usr/local/lib
