To build the library, type

./configure; make

There are several driver programs (drivers/*.cc) which make use of
the library which gets built in lib/.

The configuration process is currently very basic, and only tries
to find the GMP/MPFR/GMPFRXX libraries in one place depending on
what type of system you are on.  This could definitely be improved.
